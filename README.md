#Scripts

This repo includes general scripts I use.
Here's a brief description of each:

* iommuCheck.sh
	- taken from the arch linux wiki to show whether IOMMU has been enabled properly

* savWS.py
	- was used on my i3 config to restore the window layout after using tvon/off scripts

* setbg.sh
	- sets background to the image given in the argument. Runs pywal and outputs xrdb to a file which can be read by xmonad for the wm color themes
